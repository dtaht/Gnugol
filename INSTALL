* gnugol
  The curl-dev and jansson-1.3 libraries are required.
  (gnugol does not currently compile against the jansson git tree. use 1.3)

Does not yet work with libjansson-2.x.

  Under debian derived OSes, installing the build dependencies for curl-dev
is sufficient to get most of what gnugol needs, then you have to fetch
and build jansson, then gnugol should build without complaint.

sudo apt-get install curl-dev

wget http://www.digip.org/jansson/releases/jansson-1.3.tar.bz2
tar xjf jansson-1.3.tar.bz2
cd jansson-1.3
./configure && make && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig

for gnugol, in the Gnugol root tree, do a:

make && sudo make install

gnugol the keywords from there.

NOTE: gnugol requires that your terminal and emacs session be running in 
utf-8 or ASCII rather than any other character set. You can usually 
configure your system and keyboard to operate in utf-8 via your 
graphical environment's settings, and you can tell emacs to operate 
in it by putting the following in your .emacs file. 

(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
(set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)
