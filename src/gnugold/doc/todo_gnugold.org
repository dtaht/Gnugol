Because the clients and servers are evolving rapidly, 
I'd like to expire them and require that people
get new ones every two weeks (for now) rather than 
expend lots of effort to remain backwards compatible.

Look into public key infrastructure and openID.

Implement a 2 second timeout, retry the query 3 times.
Do a dns lookup on the 2nd query.
Better: See how long the last query to this server took, 
double it, or do a rolling average or something like cubic.

Do a command line client - started

Path MTU discovery?

IPv4 UDP

gnugol over other transports (irc bots, email)

DNS lookaside cache

Implement sha1 hashing. The hash will get used by the 
lookaside cache.

DB lookaside cache

Finalize Query protocol standard - things like languages,
number of results, etc. right now it's just keywords.

Get select on multicast/connectionless to work and timeout
Override retrys?

Implement compression. Most likely it won't help on queries.
definately helps on results.

GET THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED and pointed at toutatis.isc.org.
  forward dns is ready to go, reverse is not. networksolutions
  costs too much dough

Emacs minor mode - gimmie X number of urls. Download Y files

In order to be http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460#page-24 compliant, we
have to compute an IPv6 checksum.
